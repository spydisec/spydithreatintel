The lists below are generated from various OSINT feeds (Sefinek-Blocklist, Maltrail, Firebog, AdAway, and more). 

**A unique feature of this list is that it does not include any duplicate entries, ensuring that all three categories malicious, spam, and advers are distinct.**

- **üõë Advers/Tracking Domains:**  
  A collection of domains used for tracking and advertising purposes.  
  - **File:** [advs/unique_advtracking_domains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spydisec/spydithreatintel/refs/heads/main/advs/unique_advtracking_domains.txt)  

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Malicious Domains:**  
  Domains identified as associated with malicious activity.
