### üìß Honeypot IP Feed
- **Description**: IP addresses extracted from a production email server actively targeted by bruteforce attacks, spam campaigns, reconnaissance, and other malicious activities.  
- **File**: [honeypot_iplist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spydisec/spydithreatintel/refs/heads/main/honeypot/honeypot_iplist.txt)  

### üé≠ Domains

The repository also includes a list of domains categorized for blocking:  
The lists below are generated from various OSINT feeds (Sefinek-Blocklist, Maltrail, Firebog, AdAway, and more). 

**A unique feature of this list is that it does not include any duplicate entries, ensuring that all three categories malicious, spam, and advers are distinct.**

- **üõë Advers/Tracking Domains:**  
  A collection of domains used for tracking and advertising purposes.  
  - **File:** [advs/unique_advtracking_domains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spydisec/spydithreatintel/refs/heads/main/advs/unique_advtracking_domains.txt)  

- **üéØ Malicious Domains:**  
  Domains identified as associated with malicious activity.  
  - **File:** [mal/unique_malicious_domains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spydisec/spydithreatintel/refs/heads/main/mal/unique_malicious_domains.txt)  

- **üî´ Spam Domains:**  
  Domains recognized for sending spam and potentially harmful content.  
  - **File:** [spam/unique_spamscamabuse_domains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spydisec/spydithreatintel/refs/heads/main/spam/unique_spamscamabuse_domains.txt)  

These domains can be integrated with **Pi-hole** or firewall configurations to block unwanted traffic, enhancing your network's security.
